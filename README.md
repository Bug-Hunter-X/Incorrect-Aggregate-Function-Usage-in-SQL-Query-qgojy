This repository demonstrates a common error in SQL queries involving the incorrect usage of aggregate functions without a corresponding GROUP BY clause. The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous query, while `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version.

The issue arises when aggregate functions like `COUNT(*)`, `AVG()`, `SUM()`, etc., are used without grouping the results. This can lead to unexpected or incorrect values in the output.  The solution involves adding a `GROUP BY` clause to group the rows appropriately based on relevant columns before applying aggregate functions.

Understanding and correctly using aggregate functions with `GROUP BY` is crucial for accurate SQL query results.
